# complimentSeizure
## Everyone needs a pick-me-up ðŸ‘†
I think that there is a real lack of quality compliments in our cut-throat society. We do not actively celebrate the beauty that is all around us anymore. This application cherishes one another. 

However, this was not the intention of the application. I built it for my girlfriend as she was frustrated with the lack of compliments she received on my game, 'Kitchen Balance.'

### What I Delivered

## App Summary
The Compliment Seizure actively cherishes the beauty within one another through a series of unusual flattering and sometimes crude compliments. The application was thought, wireframed, and created in 4 hours as a joke for my girlfriend. It utilizes javascript and SCSS to create a unique and frankly annoyingly colorful user interface.
